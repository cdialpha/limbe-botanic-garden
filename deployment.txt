(1) Setup DNS Routing
    First go to Domain Name Service ==> Namecheap 
    Go to Dashboard ==> Advanced DNS 

(2) Setup Github Actions
    Go to Repo ==> Settigns ==> Pages (on sidebar)
    Change Source "Deploy from a Branch" ==> "Github Actions" 

(3) Add Custom Domain 
    www.limbebotanicgarden.com 
    
(4) Add workflow.yaml in .github folder 
    Github provides NextJS template 
    or build your own. 


(5) Diagnosing 
    - make sure to lint everything 
    - might need to delete 
    - was getting an error (cannot find "/" route)
        followed this forum https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/44002 
        suggested to remove "next export" from scripts 
        run npm i next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest eslint-config-next@latest
