          With the creation of the Integrated Conservation Education Centre
          (ICEC), conservation education aimed at a behavioral change towards
          biodiversity conservation gains a much more important role. ICEC,
          hosted in the Limbe Botanical Garden, aims to upscale conservation
          education and outreach programs for the local communities in the
          protected areas where PSMNR intervenes and also addresses the general
          public.
